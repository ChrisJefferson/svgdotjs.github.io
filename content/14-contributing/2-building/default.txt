Title: Building

# Building
After contributing you probably want to build the library to run some specs. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system, `cd` to the svg.js directory and run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Build SVG.js by running `gulp`:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

The resulting files are:

1. `dist/svg.js`
2. `dist/svg.min.js`

# Testing
There is two ways to run the test suite. One is from the command line and the other is in your browser.
To run the test suite at the command line, you need to have Firefox installed.

```sh
$ npm test
```

To run the test suite in your default browser, simply open `/spec/SpecRunner.html`. Usually by double click.
