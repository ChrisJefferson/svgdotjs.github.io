Title: Ellipse

----

Text: 

# Ellipse

`returns` __`SVG.Circle`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Shape`__

Ellipses, like rects, have two arguments, their `width` and `height`:

```javascript
var ellipse = draw.ellipse(200, 100)
```

## radius()

`returns` __`itself`__

Ellipses can also be redefined by their radii:

```javascript
ellipse.radius(75, 50)
```
